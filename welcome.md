# Welcome to Techrity Mentorship Program!

Congratulations for being accepted into the Techrity Mentorship Program! You should be proud of yourself. We are!

Techrity is a non-profit social enterprise who helps kickstart beginners in tech careers by providing vital resources like Data, laptops and mentorship support for their journey to be a success. 

Techrity mentorship program connects people who have specific skills such as coding, product management, project management, writing, etc. and knowledge (mentors) with individuals (proteges) who may need these same skills to develop their skill set.

The #Build4SocialGood Hackathon identifies specific challenges for teams to build and provide solutions for social good challenges. Hackathon participants also get access to mentors to support and direct them during the hackathon phase.

We are all about creating equal access to opportunities in Tech for Africans.

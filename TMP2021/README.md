# Techrity Mentorship Program 2021

The **Techrity Mentorship Program** is a structured program that aims to connect people via mentoring, increase knowledge and build skills.

- See [Techrity Mentorship Program 2022 Cohort II](/TMP2022/README.md)
- See our [Dos and Donts](/Dos&Donts.md) for Mentors and Mentees

## Mentors

Our mentorship program connects people who have specific skills such as coding, product management, project management, writing, etc. and knowledge (mentors) with individuals (proteges) who may need these same skills to develop their skill set.

We are continuously seeking like-minded individuals, collaborators, and mentors that share our values and believes in "Paying it Forward". Join our mentorship network and use your knowledge to serve humanity.

Top Mentors are entitled to a mentorship badge on [Mently](https://mymently.com) and a weekly feature on our blog and social media platforms with the hashtag #TechrityTopMentor. 

Come join Techrity as a Mentor. Spread kindness and goodwill by mentoring someone. 

Techrity is glad to have you as a mentor!!!

## Mentees

Outstanding Mentees would be showcased on the Techrity Website and will submit a dedicated blog post to share your experience so others can be motivated.

Our successful mentees are encouraged to pay it forward by joining the mentors to mentor other learners.
